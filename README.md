//Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The key milestones of the software engineering evolution according to the National Library of Medicine:
2.1. SE Era I: Mastering the Machine (1956–1967)
During this phase, the term software engineering had not yet been introduced. The focus was primarily on optimizing software to exploit limited hardware resources. Software development was largely shaped by external constraints, with the first compilers and non-interactive operating systems marking the technological advancements of the time. The need for more interactive and manageable environments led to the creation of low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools for editing, compiling, and debugging. However, the lack of defined development methods posed significant risks, highlighting the need for more structured approaches.

2.2. SE Era II: Mastering the Process (1968–1982)
This era saw the emergence of the first software crisis, which directly led to the birth of software engineering as a discipline. The primary aim was to reduce risks during development and enhance quality and productivity. This period witnessed the development of the first software development methodologies, which focused on defining and monitoring the software-building process. Formal modeling approaches were introduced to automate implementation. However, these formal methods were not practical for large-scale systems due to the lack of tools and proper training. During this phase, the importance of structured predesign phases and formal models, such as Software Requirement Engineering Methodology (SREM) and Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT), became evident.

2.3. SE Era III: Mastering the Complexity (1983–1992)
With the arrival of personal computers, the dominance of hardware over software came to an end. This era marked a shift towards software development that focused on comprehensive analysis and design. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and visual programming made software more accessible to users, bringing development closer to customer needs. The development of object-oriented (OO) methods emerged as a significant advancement, enabling more efficient reuse of software components, which improved productivity. The integration of data modeling and function modeling methodologies allowed for better software design and development practices, as OO principles were applied throughout the software lifecycle—from design and coding to specification and analysis.



//List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that includes seven key phases: Planning, Requirements Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. These phases guide software creation from concept to launch and beyond, ensuring quality, efficiency, and alignment with user needs and business goals.
1)Planning: Defines the software's purpose and scope, outlines the tasks, and evaluates feasibility. Key documents like the Project Plan and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) are created.
2)Requirements Analysis: Gathers and analyzes user needs to specify the software's functionality. A Requirements Specification Document is created to guide development.
3)Design: Builds the software's framework, including its structure, navigation, and user interface. The result is the Software Design Document (SDD), which guides the coding phase.
4)Coding: Developers write the software based on the design, ensuring functionality and efficiency. Regular code reviews ensure high standards and quality.
5)Testing: Software is rigorously tested for bugs and glitches. Different testing methods ensure the software meets requirements and is ready for deployment.
6)Deployment: The software is launched to users with minimal disruption. This phase often includes creating user manuals, training, and support to ensure smooth adoption.
7)Maintenance: After deployment, the software is continuously improved and updated based on user feedback, ensuring its longevity and effectiveness.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
